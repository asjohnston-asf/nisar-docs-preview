# AWS S3 Access

## Overview
All NISAR data is hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud via the Simple Storage Service (S3). Data users can request temporary AWS credentials enabling direct access to the data in S3. This supports the use of a wide range of S3-aware tooling for interacting with cloud-hosted data as well as for low-latency and high-throughput data access patterns.

## Limitations

S3 Access for NISAR data is subject to several limitations:
- The temporary credentials only allow access from within the us-west-2 region
- The temporary credentials expire after one hour.

## Accessing NISAR Data via S3

1. Visit https://nisar.asf.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentials
2. Configure your environment to use the temporary credentials
3. Explore the `` S3 bucket
