the Sun) ionizes atmospheric atoms and molecules forming the ionosphere. Its refractivity is mainly controlled by the \n\ntotal electron content. The propagation of the microwave signal traveling through the ionosphere results in a group delay and a phase advance.\n\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI)\n\nThe undesired signal in the form of wideband or narrowband interference that overlaps with the in-band frequency spectrum of NISAR. The main sources of high-power RFI are electromagnetic signals from civilian and military ground-based communication or radar platforms. RFI detection is performed on L0B raw data before focusing.\n\nRadiometric Terrain Correction (RTC)\n\nThe NISAR geocoded covariance (GCOV) product is radiometrically terrain\ncorrected to normalize the SAR backscatter to gamma-naught \\gamma^0. The GCOV algorithm is using an area-projection algorithm \n\nShiroma et al., 2022 to compute RTC correction factor and to geocode the data.\n\nSolid Earth Tides (SET)\n\nThe motion of the Earth’s surface is driven by the gravitational pull from the Sun and the Moon (solid Earth tides), the change of the rotational axis (pole tides), the loading\neffects from the ocean tides (OTL), the atmospheric and hydrological loading as well as the surface deformation. Displacements from tidal and loading effects are periodic with different time scales and amplitudes \n\nYunjun et al., 2022. SET often reaches 40 and 10 cm in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively \n\nPetit & Luzum, 2010\n\nTotal Electron Content\n\nTwo components of the Total Electron Content (TEC) data from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are sampled every 10 seconds along the NISAR orbit: the integrated TEC from surface to the GNSS orbit and the top-side TEC. The difference of the two results in sub-orbital TEC is used to estimate range delay and the azimuth shifts.\n\nTropospheric delay\n\nAt altitudes up to ~ 30 km, which forms the troposphere, refractivity is mainly controlled by temperature, water vapor, and dry air partial pressure \n\nBerrada Baby et al., 1988. The zenith hydrostatic delay is ~2.3 m at sea level at typical meteorological conditions, while the zenith wet delay varies from a few mm at the polar region to ∼40 cm at the equatorial region \n\nBöhm & Schuh, 2013.

This part of the NISAR data is best represented in the GCOV products. The individual covariance layers in the GCOV product can be used like Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) products. The pixel values represent the intensity of radar backscatter, with a different layer for each polarization.\n\nThe values in the GCOV covariance layers represent the conditions of the scatterers on the earth’s surface in that area, and can indicate the degree of surface roughness, structural complexity, and relative moisture content. These values are impacted by changes to the physical structure of the earth’s surface, including processes that alter vegetation or built structures.\n\nBecause of NISAR’s regular acquisition schedule and insensitivity to cloud cover, data is available at regular intervals all over the world. This makes it very valuable for time-series analysis, which can be used to track short- or long-term changes to natural and anthropogenic features.\n\nThe L-band sensor can penetrate through moderately complex vegetation and more deeply into the soil than C-band SAR sensors such as Sentinel-1.

This can be used as a proxy for distance, and is the basis of SAR Interferometry (InSAR). By differencing the phase values from one acquisition to another with the same footprint, InSAR allows users to identify and quantify surface deformation that occurred in the time between acquisitions.\n\nInSAR analysis can quantify differences in the line-of-sight of the sensor to the centimeter scale, making it a powerful tool for monitoring deformation over large areas. It can be used in conjunction with GNSS measurements, surveys, and LiDAR measurements to expand these high-accuracy measurements to a much broader scale.\n\nPhase measurements, especially at L-band wavelengths, are sensitive to atmospheric changes from one acquisition to the next, so it is vital to consider how these changes can impact your interpretation of InSAR measurements. NISAR provides a number of resources packaged in with products such as the GUNWs that can be used for atmospheric corrections, and there are also time-series approaches that can help mitigate the impact of atmospheric conditions.\n\nInSAR analysis can be used to detect and quantify surface movements or changes caused by geophysical processes or human activities that result in the signal having to travel a different distance to interact with the scattering surface. This can be due to volcanic or tectonic activity, earth-moving for construction or extraction purposes, and subsidence or uplift due to changes in groundwater or underground reservoirs.\n\nInSAR also generates a coherence measurement, which may be useful for indicating change. If the phase spectra from one acquisition to another differ so much that they can’t be compared, that can indicate an area that has undergone such drastic change that it can’t be resolved. This indicates the quality of the phase difference calculation, but can also serve as an indicator of change.","type":"content","url":"/phase","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/atbd","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents"},"content":"Two algorithm theoretical basis documents (ATBDs) summarize how the data is processed at various processing levels:\n\nNISAR L1 and L2 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document \n\nNISAR Algorithm Development Team, 2023\n\nNISAR L3 Soil Moisture Data Product: Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) \n\nNISAR Soil Moisture Science Team, 2023\n\nThere are other ATBDs summarizing the findings of the NISAR science team regarding how the requirements for generating particular data products are met:\n\nAlgorithms to Validate NISAR L2 Coseismic, Transient and Secular Displacement Requirements \n\nNISAR Solid Earth Team, 2022\n\nNISAR L3 Ice Sheets and Glacier Products \n\nJoughin et al., 2022\n\nNISAR L2 Sea Ice Motion Product \n\nHolt, 2022\n\nNISAR Ecosystem L2 Products \n\nSiqueira et al., 2018","type":"content","url":"/atbd","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Format"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/data-format","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Data Format"},"content":"All NISAR standard products are in the \n\nHierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5).

These grids are defined for all NISAR level 1 (L1) and level 2 (L2) products. Users are advised to use three-dimensional interpolation routines (for Python, use the RegularGridInterpolator function of the open-source software scipy) to calculate values for several parameters for useful initial data analysis within a GIS environment. The geolocation error using the grids is estimated to be 1.5 cm. Further analysis is expected to lead to a more robust error estimate.\n\nThe example below shows the geolocation grid defined for an L1 RIFG product. Using slant range, zero Doppler time, and height above ellipsoid as the grid axes serve as input to calculate the values of all other parameters.\n\n{\n  \"granule\":
